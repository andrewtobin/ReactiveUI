Model-View-ViewModel, or MVVM for short, is a variation of is a variation of Martin Fowler's Presentation Model pattern. 
MVVM abstracts a view's state and behavior making view independent of any specific UI framework. 

MVVM promotes event-driven programming of user interfaces, and declarative property and command binding.

* Model - provides a domain model to some state content or to a data-layer representing content in a data-centric approach.

* View - any of UI Frameworks, including WPF, Silverlight, Cocoa and others.

* View Model - a "model of the view", an abstraction of Viewm which uses platform specifc binder to mediate communication between View and Model.
